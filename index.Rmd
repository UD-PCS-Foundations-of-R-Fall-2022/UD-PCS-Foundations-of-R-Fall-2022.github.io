### Week 02 - Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis {#week-02---introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis}

We will use the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework as a way to begin working with R. A key component of EDA is visualizing data. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding packages and how to download, manage, and maintain themÂ 

-   Understanding the Exploratory Data Analysis lifecycle

-   Importing data into R from Excel files and .csvs

-   Visualizing data using \`ggplot2\`

-   [A layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html)

### Week 03 - Introduction to the tidyverse {#week-03---introduction-to-the-tidyverse}

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages that share a similar design philosophy. These tools allow for complex data transformations that aid in the EDA process. Topics covered will include:

-   Data transformation using the `dplyr` package
-   Common functions for data transformation (`select`, `filter`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarize`)
-   Piping functions using `magrittr`
-   Creating reproducible examples for troubleshooting (`reprex`)

### Week 04 - Data cleaning tools {#week-04---data-cleaning-tools}

No two datasets require the same data cleaning in order to prepare them for analysis. A variety of tools are needed in order to perform data transformations. We will explore a variety of functions that aid in this process. Topics covered will include:

-   Utilizing conditional statements using `if_else` and `case_when`
-   Manipulating data `across` columns
-   Addressing missing data using `replace` and `replace_na`
-   Addressing missing data using `fill`

#### `r emo::ji("books")` Readings

##### Textbook

-   [Chapter 12 - Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)
-   [Chapter 13 - Relational data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)

### Week 05 - Joining & Reshaping Datasets

Oftentimes, the data that we work with is not contained in a single table, but multiple. In cases like this, we must "join" data together. Further, data is frequently in the wrong "shape" for analysis - sometimes it must be "wide" and sometimes it must be "long". The tidyverse provides tools to more easily shape data to support analysis. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding types of joins - right, left, inner, etc.
-   Identifying "tidy" data Reshaping data using `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer`
-   Using tidy data to create more complex data visualizations with `ggplot2`

#### `r emo::ji("books")` Readings

##### Textbook

-   [Chapter 14 - Strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)
-   [Chapter 15 - Factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)
-   [Chapter 16 - Dates and times](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)

### Week 06 - Manipulation of Strings, Factors, and Datetimes {#week-06---manipulation-of-strings-factors-and-datetimes}

Numeric values are not the only type of data that we must learn to manipulate. Data is often presented as strings, factors, or datetimes. Each of these data types can be manipulated in different ways. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding differences between strings and factors
-   String manipulation utilizing the `stringr` package and string matching concepts utilizing regex
-   Using `forcats` for factor manipulation
-   Using `lubridate` to manipulate dates

#### `r emo::ji("books")` Readings

##### Textbook

-   [Chapter 19 - Functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)

### Week 07 - Creating Functions {#week-07---creating-functions}

While packages provide a wide variety of functions, R becomes more powerful when you begin to build your own functions. Topics covered will include:

-   Understand what functions are
-   Best practices for creating functions
-   Understand available tools for debugging functions
-   Building functions using non-standard evaluation using the embrace paradigm

#### `r emo::ji("books")` Readings

##### Textbook

-   [Chapter 21 - Iteration](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html)

### Week 08 - Functional Programming {#week-08---functional-programming}

As our analyses advance, we will frequently find situations where we need to write the same code multiple times. This can cause our code to be error prone. Functional programming allows us to create more concise code through iteration. Topics covered will include:

-   The relationship between loops and functional programming
-   Vectorizing code
-   The `map` paradigm
